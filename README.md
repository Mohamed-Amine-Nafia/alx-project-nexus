## üìö Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** is a structured learning path designed to build strong foundations in modern frontend development.  
It emphasizes **practical learning**, collaboration with backend developers, and the adoption of industry best practices to create real-world applications.

Through this program, I explored both **theoretical concepts** and **hands-on projects**, preparing me for professional frontend engineering roles.
